        <p>
            In the Blizzard Snowboarding League, teams are at the heart of the competition. 
            A team can consist of amateur and professional riders, bringing together a mix 
            of experience and skill. Each team is encouraged to have a diverse roster to 
            compete across various events, including slalom, halfpipe, big air, and freestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teams can be formed independently or through our league's matchmaking system, which 
            pairs individual riders based on skill levels and competition categories. We 
            emphasize camaraderie, sportsmanship, and collective growth, with teams often seen 
            training together and strategizing to maximize their strengths.
        </p>
